# :briefcase: Welcome to my Github profile

I am a developer in the making, specialized in using AI technologies for finding solutions, and follow the project from A to Z. I use the term 'full-stack' to make the parallel with the well known web-developpment paradigm. The idea, at the end, is to have the general knowledge to:

* Set up and manage a database
* Differentiate AI technologies and solutions
* Know when to implement APIs vs when to create new AI models
* Train an AI model
* Create API services
* Develop the front end of a web app to showcase the funcionalities of the AI service
* Manage through a ML-OPs paradigm the created app/services
